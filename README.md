# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecom company using data science techniques. The goal is to explore the factors that influence customer retention and churn, and to build predictive models that help businesses improve customer loyalty.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand customer behavior through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize insights with appropriate plots and charts.
- Build machine learning models to predict churn.
- Evaluate model performance.
